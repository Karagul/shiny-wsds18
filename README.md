Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight 
from R. With Shiny, you can create standalone apps, embed them in R Markdown 
documents, build dashboards, and much more. This course will introduce you to 
the basics of building web applications and dashboards with Shiny, essentials of 
reactive programming, and how to customize and deploy your apps for others to use. 
If you want to take a fresh, interactive approach to telling your data story, let 
users interact with your data and your analysis, and do it all with R, this 
workshop is for you! Please bring a laptop with you to the course.
